# Hey,

#### I'm Drew, a former Marine that has done a *ton of stuff* in the last 29 years ...

I recenetly left my management role at downtown Chicago restaurant group and moved to Thailand to focus on pivoting my career towards web development.

I have now spent 8 Months in Thailand focused on learning development languages like `Javascript` `HTML5` `CSS3` `JQuery`.


I also spent an emence amount of time ~~breaking~~ building projects to gain a fluididty with the languages. The idea of thinking in the language and not just writing it was a big barrier to overcome.

Most importantly I dedicated time to trianing my brain to *think* like a web developer. breaking down problems to their smallest sub problem and solving what I knew(10%) and Googling what I didnt(90%).

8 months later I'm headed back the the <span>US</span> to nail down my first Jr. Dev role at age 30!

That's where you come in. I'm looking for a growing company that is working on a new and exciting project


``` javascript
function name(){
  let fName = "Drew";
  let lName = "Since";
  var name =  fName + "" + lName;
  var message = ("Hey I'm " + name + ".");
  return message;
}
name()
```
