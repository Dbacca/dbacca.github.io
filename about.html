## About

Hey, I'm Drew, a former Marine that has found a passion for front end development and has recently pivoted his life and moved to Thailand to focus on the new found passion Now that I have learned some languages and frameworks and created projects with them, II'm ready to move back to the States in October and start working!

Im looking to work at a tech start up in Seattle primarily. Not just any new company I want to find a company that shares some of my commitments and passions. I love wakeboarding in the summer and snowboarding in the winter, travelling in southeast Asia for the past 9 months has been absolutely incredible!


 I love  restaurants, not just the food but, the energy and controlled chaos that is a restaurant running full speed!
