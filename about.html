### Hey,

I'm Drew, a former Marine that has found a passion for front end development and has recently pivoted his life and moved to Thailand to focus on the new found passion.

Im looking to work at a tech start up in Seattle primarily. Not just any new company I want to find a company that shares some of my commitments and passions. I love wakeboarding in the summer and snowboarding in the winter, travelling in southeast Asia for the past 9 months has been absolutely incredible!

If you are seeing this site hopefully you got my video and are willign to have a conversation to see if we click!
