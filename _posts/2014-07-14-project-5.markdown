description: This client needed a modern design overhaul. We chose WordPress as the CMS. I then walked them through the discovery/design phase to understand their goals for the site and get a feel for their Brand. I then designed mock ups for the client based off the <a href="http://www.nimbusthemes.com/wordpress-themes/business/">Simple Business Theme</a> by Nimbus Themes. The Site went live in July and we are constantly adding features and functionality. <br><br> <strong>View Live <a href="http://secure-itnet.com">SECURE ITnet</a></strong>
